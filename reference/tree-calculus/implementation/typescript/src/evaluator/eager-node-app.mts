// Disclaimer: It may seem like a good idea to represent expressions as binary trees
// where leaves are △ and inner nodes are function application. This implementation
// aims to demonstrate that this is not a good idea, at least compared to the other
// strategies presented here.
//
// Problems:
// * There is no natural distinction between redex and value. Just to check whether a
//   subtree is reducible requires traversing a bunch of pointers. Note that finding
//   a △ applied to three (or more) parameters is not sufficient alone. The first
//   argument needs to be reduced enough to distinguish whether it's a leaf, stem or
//   fork. If it's a fork, the same is necessary for the third argument. Below, the
//   strategy around this is to enforce an eager evaluation order. A lazy strategy
//   would need to traverse even more pointers -- or do something like tagging
//   subtrees as values. At that point, one may as well make leafs, stems and forks
//   first-class constructs.
// * When having reduced a subtree, it's annoying to track who had a reference to
//   the unreduced subtree and hence should be updated. It might be the left/right
//   side of some application node, it might be the original "apply" caller. Note
//   how adding another level of indirection (cells/references/pointers) increases
//   the amount of pointer traversing even more, while not straightforwardly solving
//   the problem either: Reduction of "△ △ a b" to "a" must effectively *unify* the
//   pointers representing those two expressions. After all, "a" might reduce further
//   and we'll want to update anyone who originally referred to either expression.
//   The strategy below gets around this by being eager: "a" is already a value by
//   the time we encounter the reduction of "△ △ a b".
//
// The other reference implementations should speak for themselves: Less code, easier
// to reason about, faster.
